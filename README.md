### About

This is a simple `Express` API that serves as storage for a cart of a store page. It handles adding and removing specific items from the cart, as well as deleting it all. It also handles some simple operations such as retrieving all the cart and sending the total price of all the stored items.

It works with a mock up `cart` model that contains all the information for the application to work.
